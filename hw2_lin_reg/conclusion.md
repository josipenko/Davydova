As it can be seen from comparison of handwritten linear regression with sklearn implemented version, the MSE loss obtained by sklearn version of linear regression is lower than the handwritten version.
This is explained by the fact that the handwritten version doesn't take into account bias terms, which are important in the case under consideration.
