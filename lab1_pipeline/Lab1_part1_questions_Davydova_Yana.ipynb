While foreground differences can obviously contribute to pixel deltas, in some cases the background of an image can be a relatively huge proportion of the image which can heavily contribute to a significant pixel-level differences. For the case of distinctly bright rows, we can infer that for the particular test image corresponding to that row, the test images' contents have a distinctly different foreground/background that leads to a significantly large pixel delta.\n","-  The distinctly bright columns can be due to a particular train image having content that does not match the test images (this training data point doesn't have any similar points in the test set).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hIpv0Dan9pJ6"},"source":["### Question 2\n","\n","We can also use other distance metrics such as L1 distance.\n","For pixel values $p_{ij}^{(k)}$ at location $(i,j)$ of some image $I_k$,\n","\n","the mean $\\mu$ across all pixels over all images is $$\\mu=\\frac{1}{nhw}\\sum_{k=1}^n\\sum_{i=1}^{h}\\sum_{j=1}^{w}p_{ij}^{(k)}$$\n","And the pixel-wise mean $\\mu_{ij}$ across all images is\n","$$\\mu_{ij}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^np_{ij}^{(k)}.$$\n","The general standard deviation $\\sigma$ and pixel-wise standard deviation $\\sigma_{ij}$ is defined similarly.\n","\n","Which of the following preprocessing steps will not change the performance of a Nearest Neighbor classifier that uses L1 distance?
